                            Hey, I'm Oliver! I'm from Denmark and recently completed my Computer Science
                            degree.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
                            I've always been passionate about gaming, training, and technology.
                            Gaming sparked my interest in programming early on â€” leading me to learn C#,
                            build small projects in Unity, and eventually pursue software development and
                            engineering professionally.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
                            Today, I specialize in software, web, and game development, while continuously
                            expanding my skills in areas like Linux systems, cloud computing, networking,
                            server configuration, security, automation, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
                            I'm passionate about creating, learning, and improving every day. I'm excited
                            to keep growing as a developer and to see where the next project or idea will
                            take me.
